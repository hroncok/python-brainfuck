python-brainfuck [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hroncok/python-brainfuck.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hroncok/python-brainfuck)
================

Very primitive BrainFuck, BrainLoller and BrainCoppter interpreter written in Python without any external dependencies.

It currently support only some kind of PNGs (mn82000 IHDR) as input.

Run `./brainx.py --help` for some help.

Enjoy.
